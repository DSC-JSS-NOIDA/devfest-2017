## The most important – Hackathon Score bump-up.

Your team earns huge additional brownie points in the final scores of Hackathon depending on the cumulative number of books you upload as a team. Remember these may just be the deciding points in your win. Scoring is as follows:

* Max 5% if your team together uploads the highest number of books with each member uploading atleast one.

* 4% if your team together uploads 5 books with each member uploading atleast one.

* 3% if your team together uploads 4 books with each member uploading atleast one.

* 2% if your team together uploads 3 books with each member uploading atleast one.

* 1% if your team together uploads 2 books with each member uploading atleast one (generally applies for two member team).

### You also lose points
*  Minus 1% for each member for not uploading a book from what you score above (example: In a team of 3 members scoring 4 points with rules above, if 2 members don’t upload a book from their own profiles the net team score will be (4 – 2) = 2).

* Don’t worry if you are a one member team. You don’t lose any points for your non-existent team members not complying ;)

*  Word of caution – do imagine scenarios where you can accumulate overall negative score inspite of being a big team!

**All the best!**

Heads I win, Tails you lose: Obviously, you participate with an agreement that we hold the last dispassionate decision without your contest/challenge.
